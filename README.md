## This project:
This work proposes an empirical investigation to define the best JVM arguments in six specific scenarios, aiming to optimize both performance and resource savings. The application was tested in an isolated environment with limited hardware, using tools such as JMeter and cAdvisor to collect and analyze performance metrics, based on the premise that precise adjustments can significantly improve both the stability and response of the application.
